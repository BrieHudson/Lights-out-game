# Lights-out-game

Description

This project implements a grid of cells that users can interact with. By clicking a cell, it toggles between two states: lit (green) and unlit (red). The game logic ensures that the cells and their surrounding cells are toggled when one is clicked. This interactive game board can be extended with additional features such as winning conditions, more complex interactions, or animations.

Technologies Used
